**IMPORTANT RULE:** You must ONLY use the information and concepts present in the original content. Do not introduce any external facts, examples, or information. Your goal is to adapt the existing text, not to add new knowledge.

**Original Content (for {{gradeLevel}} {{subject}}):**
---
{{{originalContent}}}
---

Please generate versions for the following levels:
{{#each levels}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}

For each level, rewrite the original content to match the target audience's needs. For "Simpler Language," use shorter sentences and more basic vocabulary. For "Advanced Challenge," use more complex sentence structures and vocabulary, and perhaps reframe parts as more analytical questions, but without adding new information.
