    **Student:** {{{studentName}}}
    **Grade:** {{{grade}}}
    **Subject:** {{{subject}}}

    **Conversation History:**
    ---
    {{#each chatHistory}}
      **{{role}}:** {{{content}}}
    {{/each}}
    ---

    **Instructions:**
    1.  **Analyze Strengths:** Review the conversation and identify where the student demonstrated good understanding, asked insightful questions, or was highly engaged. Summarize this in 1-2 positive sentences.
    2.  **Identify Areas for Improvement:** Pinpoint concepts the student found confusing, or where their understanding is still developing. Summarize this as a constructive, 1-2 sentence suggestion for the teacher. Focus on what the teacher can do to help.
