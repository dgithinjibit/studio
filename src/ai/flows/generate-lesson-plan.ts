    ## Organization of Learning

    ### Introduction (5 Minutes)
    - **Learner is guided to:** engage in a brief, interactive activity related to "{{topic}}". For example, a quick poll, a think-pair-share question, or watching a short, relevant video clip to spark curiosity.

    ### Lesson Development (25 Minutes)
    - **Learner is guided to:** participate in the first core activity based on the 'Suggested Learning Experiences' from the scheme. This should be a practical, hands-on task. (e.g., "in groups, collect and prepare locally available materials...").
    - **Learner is guided to:** collaborate with peers on a second activity that builds upon the first. This step should involve discussion, creation, or problem-solving. (e.g., "practice the skill of... in pairs", "assemble tools and materials...").
    - **Learner is guided to:** present or share their work from the previous step. This could be a gallery walk, a short group presentation, or a demonstration of the skill learned.

    ### Conclusion (5 Minutes)
    - **Learner is guided to:** summarize the main takeaways of the lesson by answering the Key Inquiry Question(s) and share what they found most interesting or challenging.

    ## Extended Activity
    - **Learner is guided to:** undertake a simple, creative, and relevant take-home activity that reinforces the lesson's outcomes.

    ## Teacher's Reflection
    - [This section MUST be left blank for the teacher to fill in after the lesson.]`,
