Vision: To empower every Kenyan learner with the competencies to understand, use, and create with Artificial Intelligence ethically and effectively, fostering a generation of innovators and critical thinkers for the digital economy.

Guiding Principles: Personalization, Practical Application, Ethical Foundation, Cultural Relevance, and Inclusive Access.

## Early Years Education (Grade 1 - 3): Introduction to Computational Thinking
Objective: To seamlessly integrate foundational concepts of computational thinking into existing learning areas through play and discovery, without explicit mention of "AI."

### Grade 1
- **Environmental Activities:**
  - **Competency:** I can follow a simple sequence (algorithm) to plant a bean seed (e.g., dig hole, drop seed, cover, water).
  - **Activity:** "The Planting Dance." Learners create a physical dance with steps that must be followed in order.
- **Mathematics:**
  - **Competency:** I can sort and group objects by a single feature (e.g., colour, shape). This is a basic form of pattern recognition and classification.
  - **Activity:** "Toy Sort." Using classroom toys, learners group them based on different rules set by the teacher or peers.

### Grade 2
- **Language Activities:**
  - **Competency:** I can create a simple story using a sequence of pictures (storyboarding).
  - **Activity:** "Picture Story." Learners draw 4 pictures of a familiar activity (e.g., making chai) and explain the steps to a partner.
- **Physical Education:**
  - **Competency:** I can give and follow clear instructions to navigate a simple obstacle course.
  - **Activity:** "Robot Buddy." One learner is the "robot," the other is the "programmer" who gives precise instructions ("take 3 steps forward, turn left").

### Grade 3
- **Mathematics:**
  - **Competency:** I can identify and describe repeating patterns in beads, songs, and nature.
  - **Activity:** "Nature's Patterns." Learners find patterns in leaves, animal coats, and traditional fabrics like kanga. They create their own pattern rules.
- **Digital Literacy:**
  - **Competency:** I can use a tablet to take photos of different objects.
  - **Activity:** "My Pattern Collection." Learners take photos of 5 things that are "smooth" and 5 things that are "rough," creating their own dataset.

## Middle School (Grade 4 - 6): Discovering AI in the World
Objective: To move from implicit to explicit understanding, naming AI concepts and showing how they are applied in familiar, everyday Kenyan contexts.

### Grade 4
- **Science & Technology:**
  - **Competency:** I can define an algorithm as a step-by-step instruction to solve a problem.
  - **Lesson:** "Algorithms All Around Us." Learners write algorithms for daily routines (brushing teeth, making a sandwich). They use a block-based coding app (like ScratchJr) to make a simple animation.
- **Social Studies:**
  - **Competency:** I can describe how technology like M-Pesa helps people in my community.
  - **Discussion:** "How does M-Pesa work?" Teacher-guided discussion on the technology behind sending money. Introduces the concept of data security.

### Grade 5
- **Science & Technology:**
  - **Competency:** I can explain how a simple computer program uses "IF...THEN" rules to make decisions.
  - **Activity:** "Smart Thermostat." Learners design rules for a fictional smart house in Nairobi (e.g., IF time is night, THEN turn lights off).
- **English:**
  - **Competency:** I can use a digital dictionary or translation tool to find the meaning of words.
  - **Activity:** "Tool Explorer." Learners compare looking up a word in a physical dictionary vs. a digital one. Discusses pros and cons (speed vs. understanding).

### Grade 6
- **Science & Technology:**
  - **Competency:** I can train a simple machine learning model to recognize images (e.g., rocks vs. minerals, maize vs. wheat).
  - **Project:** "Crop Classifier." Using a child-friendly ML tool (like Google's Teachable Machine), learners take photos and train a model to classify two different types of local plants.
- **Social Studies:**
  - **Competency:** I can identify one example of how bias in data can make technology unfair.
  - **Case Study:** "The Biased Ballpoint." Discuss a real-world example (e.g., a soap dispenser that doesn't work on dark skin). Relate it to why diverse data is important in Kenya.

## Junior Secondary (Grade 7 - 9): Building AI Applications
Objective: To transition from using AI tools to designing and building basic AI applications, with a strong emphasis on ethics and project-based learning.

### AI Foundations Strand
- **Competencies:** I can explain the difference between AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. I can describe what a neural network is at a basic level.
- **Project:** Build a Neural Network: Learners use a website (e.g., TensorFlow Playground) to visually explore how neural networks learn simple patterns.
- **Concepts:** AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks.

### AI Ethics & Society Strand
- **Competencies:** I can debate the ethical implications of facial recognition technology in public spaces in Kenya. I can explain data privacy principles.
- **Project:** Mock County Assembly: Hold a debate on a bill proposing the use of facial recognition in Nairobi CBD for security.
- **Concepts:** Algorithmic Bias, Data Privacy, Transparency, Citizenship.

### AI Applications Strand
- **Competencies:** I can build a functional chatbot that answers FAQs on a topic relevant to my community (e.g., HIV awareness, exam registration).
- **Project:** Community Helper Chatbot: Using a simple platform (e.g., Dialogflow, Rasa), learners design conversation flows and train a chatbot on a meaningful topic.
- **Concepts:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), Conversational AI, Chatbots.

### Data Literacy Strand
- **Competencies:** I can collect, clean, and visualize a simple dataset on a local issue (e.g., water access, school attendance).
- **Project:** Data for Development: Learners collect data in their school/community, input it into a spreadsheet, and create charts to tell a story and propose a solution.
- **Concepts:** Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Data Analysis.

### Programming for AI Strand
- **Competencies:** I can write simple Python code to create a program that makes decisions based on user input.
- **Project:** Coding: Learners use Python with simple libraries to create a text-based game or a basic quiz application.
- **Concepts:** Programming Logic, Variables, Functions, Data Types.
