# SyncSenta Firebase Studio Project

This is a Next.js starter project bootstrapped with Firebase Studio.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Seeding Initial Data

To use the Teacher Dashboard, you first need to seed the Firestore database with mock data.

1. Make sure your application is running (`npm run dev`).
2. Visit the following URL in your browser:
   [http://localhost:3000/api/seed](http://localhost:3000/api/seed)

This will populate the necessary data for the teacher with ID `usr_3`. After seeding, you can sign up as a teacher to see the dashboard in action.
